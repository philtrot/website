  <h1 class="c3" id="h.b059y1r1x1sf"><span class="c4">Letter 2</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you are able to stop and spend time alone, then it shows you have a well ordered mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Better to read from a few authors you pick, and master them, than many.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The poor man is the one who wants more, the cheerful and content man with low material wealth isn&rsquo;t poor.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.njobjp1muqkz"><span class="c4">Letter 3</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you cannot trust a friend and tell him everything you think, then stop seeing him as a friend. Judge people before you give them your friendship, but trust them as if they were yourself after you grant it. When in a friend&rsquo;s company, it&rsquo;s as if you were with only yourself.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.5j4l3phggatz"><span class="c4">Letter 5</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Improve yourself for its own sake, not for appearances. Balance your behavior between the ideal and the popular morality; there is no charity in making your morality repulsive to others - keep it understandable. Simple living is better than penance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cease to hope, and you will cease to fear. Hope, like fear, is set in the future. Limit your desires and you will cure fear.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.3jvossnzpqqd"><span class="c4">Letter 6</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no enjoying the possession of wisdom (or anything of value) if you cannot share it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surround yourself with people you want to be like; physically, so you can learn from their example. This is much more efficient than trying to learn from reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Become your own friend, you will never be alone, and a friend to all.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.lyj29ldaw371"><span class="c4">Letter 7</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Avoid mass crowds, they will corrupt you no matter how good you are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Be very careful about entertainment, vices easily creep through it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Associate with people who can improve you, and welcome those you can improve. Men learn as they teach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t desire the majority&rsquo;s approval, but instead see it as a red flag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A single friend is enough of an audience for anyone.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.letmpuehr3df"><span class="c4">Letter 8</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Avoiding crowds and spending time in isolation doesn&rsquo;t mean you have shut off the world; you can in fact have a better impact in this way. Appearing inactive can hide quite the opposite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Be very suspicious of the approval of the mob, or of the gifts of chance, they are bait - things that will own you instead of you owning them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The body needs to be treated somewhat strictly to prevent it from becoming disobedient to the spirit. Indulge it only in what it needs for good health (eg. just enough food for hunger, no luxury).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t matter who speaks the truth, it belongs to everybody. Don&rsquo;t shut your ears to the truth because it is said by the enemy/rival.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.c5qgzuvmpg8a"><span class="c4">Letter 9</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Be content with yourself. It is still normal to have needs, but they should never be a requirement for your happiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if you are able to be happy without friends, you can still desire friendship. It is a natural impulse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you make friends like business deals, only for their usefulness, they will leave you quickly when you cannot fulfill your part. Instead, pursue friendship for its own sake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leading a happy life is independent to any desire you manage to fulfill and to whatever is taken away from you. Indeed, all you need is a rational and elevated spirit that treats fortune with disdain.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.2qhlmqn1r27u"><span class="c4">Letter 11</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Find a good man, somebody that is worth your reverence, to set your affection on, and do everything as if he saw what you are doing. See him as your guardian or your model. Use him as a standard to measure yourself against.</span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.4rlb30apvcza"><span class="c4">Letter 12</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyday should be lived as if it was the last, the one that completes your life. Death doesn&rsquo;t care about your age, it should always be right before your eyes. Everyday, say &ldquo;I have lived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If God adds the morrow, accept it joyfully. Don&rsquo;t worry over it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
