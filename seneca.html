    <h2><span >Letter 2</span></h2><p ><span >If you are able to stop and spend time alone, then it shows you have a well ordered mind.</span></p><p ><span >Better to read from a few authors you pick, and master them, than many.</span></p><p ><span >The poor man is the one who wants more, the cheerful and content man with low material wealth isn&rsquo;t poor.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 3</span></h2><p ><span >If you cannot trust a friend and tell him everything you think, then stop seeing him as a friend. Judge people before you give them your friendship, but trust them as if they were yourself after you grant it. When in a friend&rsquo;s company, it&rsquo;s as if you were with only yourself.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 5</span></h2><p ><span >Improve yourself for its own sake, not for appearances. Balance your behavior between the ideal and the popular morality; there is no charity in making your morality repulsive to others - keep it understandable. Simple living is better than penance.</span></p><p ><span >Cease to hope, and you will cease to fear. Hope, like fear, is set in the future. Limit your desires and you will cure fear.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 6</span></h2><p ><span >There is no enjoying the possession of wisdom (or anything of value) if you cannot share it.</span></p><p ><span >Surround yourself with people you want to be like; physically, so you can learn from their example. This is much more efficient than trying to learn from reading.</span></p><p ><span >Become your own friend, you will never be alone, and a friend to all.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 7</span></h2><p ><span >Avoid mass crowds, they will corrupt you no matter how good you are.</span></p><p ><span >Be very careful about entertainment, vices easily creep through it.</span></p><p ><span >Associate with people who can improve you, and welcome those you can improve. Men learn as they teach.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t desire the majority&rsquo;s approval, but instead see it as a red flag.</span></p><p ><span >A single friend is enough of an audience for anyone.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 8</span></h2><p ><span >Avoiding crowds and spending time in isolation doesn&rsquo;t mean you have shut off the world; you can in fact have a better impact in this way.</span></p><p ><span >Be very suspicious of the approval of the mob, or of the gifts of chance, they are bait - things that will own you instead of you owning them.</span></p><p ><span >The body needs to be treated somewhat strictly to prevent it from becoming disobedient to the spirit. Indulge it only in what it needs for good health (eg. just enough food for hunger, no luxury).</span></p><p ><span >It doesn&rsquo;t matter who speaks the truth, it belongs to everybody. Don&rsquo;t shut your ears to the truth because it is said by the enemy/rival.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 9</span></h2><p ><span >Be content with yourself. It is still normal to have needs, but they should never be a requirement for your happiness.</span></p><p ><span >Even if you are able to be happy without friends, you can still desire friendship. It is a natural impulse.</span></p><p ><span >If you make friends like business deals, only for their usefulness, they will leave you quickly when you are struggling and cannot fulfill your part. Instead, pursue friendship for its own sake.</span></p><p ><span >Leading a happy life is independent to any desire you manage to fulfill and to whatever is taken away from you. Indeed, the only true requirement is a rational and elevated spirit that treats fortune with disdain.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 11</span></h2><p ><span >Find a good man, somebody that is worth your reverence, to set your affection on, and do everything as if he saw what you are doing. See him as your guardian or your model. Use him as a standard to measure yourself against.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 12</span></h2><p ><span >Everyday should be lived as if it was the last, the one that completes your life. Death doesn&rsquo;t care about your age, it should always be right before your eyes. Everyday, say &ldquo;I have lived.&rdquo;</span></p><p ><span >If God adds the morrow, accept it joyfully. Don&rsquo;t worry over it.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 15</span></h2><p ><span >Being in good health is being in the pursuit of wisdom; without wisdom the mind is sick.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t waste too much time training the body when you could be training the mind instead.</span></p><p ><span >Give the mind some time off, but in a way that refreshes it. Avoid excessive relaxation.</span></p><p ><span >Instead of asking fortune for this and that, demand yourself to stop asking. You may be dead tomorrow, how will the thing you are asking for help you?</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 16</span></h2><p ><span >No one can lead a bearable life without the pursuit of wisdom, and the perfection of wisdom makes it happy.</span></p><p ><span >Making noble resolutions is less important than keeping those you have already made.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t let your spiritual enthusiasm cool off or fall away. Keep hold of it until it becomes a spiritual disposition.</span></p><p ><span >Nature&rsquo;s wants are small, all of the natural desires are limited. If you are after something that cannot ever be satisfied, be sure that it isn&rsquo;t natural.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 18</span></h2><p ><span >Live in poverty for a few days: eat nothing but cheap bread, sleep on a cheap bed and dress with ugly clothes. This will help build your confidence that you are sated without all the riches in your life, and that you would still be able to live a happy life after losing them. This exercise will allow you to own riches without fearing to lose them.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 26</span></h2><p ><span >Imagine today is the last day of your life. All that you&rsquo;ve done in the past isn&rsquo;t a good measure of how good your spirit is; how you act today is a better measure. Without anxiety about the past then, act today as if it was the single day you are judged for.</span></p><p ><span >The only chain holding you is your love of life. Don&rsquo;t throw this love away, but weaken it. Being prepared to die is the ultimate freedom.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 27</span></h2><p ><span >Look for enduring good instead of fleeting pleasures; look for what the spirit discovers for itself within itself.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 28</span></h2><p ><span >Travelling will not heal you when the reason for your anxiety and depression is in your spirit. Cure your affliction before travelling, and everywhere you arrive will feel like a hospitable home.</span></p><p ><span >It&rsquo;s better to live away from the city and its turmoil when building up the strength of the mind.</span></p><p ><span >Observe your behavior and notice your wrongdoings. Until you are aware that something is wrong, how can you desire fixing it?</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 33</span></h2><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t attempt to fill your mind with quotes and short excerpts, this is a strategy for novices and children. Give up the hope of grasping the genius of a person without examining and consuming it as a whole.</span></p><p ><span >Grown men shouldn&rsquo;t memorize sayings, but create their own. To remember something is to safeguard it in your memory. To know something is to make it your own, free from the original.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 40</span></h2><p ><span >Speak slowly, you cannot preserve your modesty if you are speaking too quickly.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 41</span></h2><p ><span >No man is good without God, we need his help to rise above fortune.</span></p><p ><span >Living in accordance with his own nature is the purpose of man. His ideal state is when he fulfills that purpose. Doing so should be easy, but is made complicated by the madness of the crowd.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 47</span></h2><p ><span >You can find men of good character everywhere. Never value a man by his social status, wealth, job or clothes; that is not what matters.</span></p><p ><span >Some men are slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition, but all men are slaves to hope and fear.</span></p><p ><span >No state of slavery is more disgraceful than the one that is self-imposed.</span></p><p ><span >Respect is love, and love cannot mix with fear.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 48</span></h2><p ><span >No one can lead a happy life if he thinks only of himself and turns everything to his own purpose. You should instead live for the other person.</span></p><p ><span >Anything that is in the interest of a friend is also your interest; all interests are shared.</span></p><p ><span >Philosophy&rsquo;s true purpose is counsel for the suffering and the worrying men.</span></p><p ><span >The laws of nature are simple, and those who follow them will enjoy a straightforward and enjoyable life.</span></p><p ><span >Since our lifetimes are so short, they should be well organized and no time should be wasted.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 53</span></h2><p ><span >Physical afflictions, as they get worse, get more noticable, more painful. By contrast, the more serve a spiritual affliction is, the less noticeable it becomes.</span></p><p ><span >How then can we see what we have lost the ability to see? Philosophy is the only tool that will help us, but she needs to be prioritized. When you are sick, you do all you can to help your body heal, it is your first priority. Why then won&rsquo;t you focus on healing the spirit by pursuing philosophy?</span></p><p ><span >Nobody attains a sound mind if he is busy with other things than philosophy. This full-time mistress doesn&rsquo;t accept time, but instead is the one that grants it for other occupations.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 54</span></h2><p ><span >Admire and imitate the man that finds it a joy to live in spite of death, and that is not reluctant to die.</span></p><p ><span >The wise man never does anything reluctantly, because he wills whatever necessity is going to force on him.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 55</span></h2><p ><span >It is wrong to assume that a man who retires is self-contented, free of all cares and living for himself. Indeed, he may very well be hiding or passive, inert. Only the philosopher can earn the previously listed blessings.</span></p><p ><span >The place you are in has no effect on your peace of mind; the spirit is what makes everything agreeable to oneself.</span></p><p ><span >When close to your friends, they are not with you most of the time. Also, during those intervals where they are missing, you aren&rsquo;t thinking about them, because they are easy to access; you are spoilt. For this reason, endure patiently the absence of your friends, but also for this other reason: friendship is spiritual. Your friend is always available to you through imagination.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 56</span></h2><p ><span >When you are annoyed and angered by noise, it is not the noise itself that is bothering you, but something internal. When your mind is peaceful, noise does not bother you.</span></p><p ><span >Night, like inaction, brings worries up to the surface. This is another reason why it is good to stay busy (with pursuits of the right nature). The harmful consequences of inactivity are dispelled by activity.</span></p><p ><span >When vices obviously show up in your behavior, they are only moderate, and can be cured. When they are very strong, they affect your behavior without you noticing. When you think they are cured, stay vigilant.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 63</span></h2><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t make your grieving last too long, it becomes a repulsive and disrespectful display. Why not go see your other friends if you are in need of consoling?</span></p><p ><span >Let the recollection of those you lost be a pleasure instead of a painful experience. They are still with you through imagination.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t miss an opportunity to see your friend when you are in the same area. Don&rsquo;t take them for granted, they could be gone tomorrow.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 65</span></h2><p ><span >Before you start thinking about abstract theories </span><span >on the</span><span >&nbsp;origin, purpose or meaning of the universe, first observe yourself and get rid of your desires and your fears.</span></p><p ><span >Thinking about abstract theories, contemplating the natural universe, can be a nice way to calm the spirit and let it taste freedom.</span></p><p ><span >The wise man neither </span><span >loves</span><span >&nbsp;nor </span><span >hates</span><span >&nbsp;life. He sees his present life as a term he has to serve.</span></p><p ><span >Everything in the universe is composed of matter and God. In man, God is the spirit and matter is the body.</span></p><p ><span >Why fear death? It&rsquo;s either a transition or an end. There is nothing to fear from an end, since it&rsquo;s like never having existed at all. There is nothing to fear from a transition, what can be worse than this?</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 77</span></h2><p ><span >An ordinary journey is incomplete if you do not reach the destination, but life never is incomplete if it is honorable. At any point, life is whole if you leave it in the right way.</span></p><p ><span >There aren&rsquo;t many solid reasons to end your own life, but there also aren&rsquo;t many solid ones not to. Life itself is slavery if you don&rsquo;t have the courage to die.</span></p><p ><span >Being scared of dying, living in fear, is like being already dead. It&rsquo;s not a life worth living.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 78</span></h2><p ><span >There are times where staying alive, even though you are in severe pain, is an act of bravery. For example, when you know your relatives or friends wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bear the loss.</span></p><p ><span >Whatever lifts the spirit also brings physical benefits. This is why positive, comforting thoughts can heal the body, cure a disease.</span></p><p ><span >Seneca&rsquo;s restoration to health was done by studying Stoic philosophy and by conversation with his supporting friends. It lifted his spirit, which brought physical healing.</span></p><p ><span >The first stages of abstinence are difficult, but the cravings stop after you endure long enough, the desires die away. There is nothing harsh about living without things you don&rsquo;t desire.</span></p><p ><span >When you are struggling or in pain, remember that even these days might someday be remembered with pleasure. As days where you gained moral strength by enduring something difficult.</span></p><p ><span >Idle and inactive leisure is the usual cause of ennui, being tired of living.</span></p><p ><span >People who measure the length of their life by the amount of unnatural pleasures, pleasures that can never be completed, will always find it short. Instead, learn that time adds nothing to the finer things in life.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 83</span></h2><p ><span >We should live as if we were in public view. Whatever you keep secret is still known to God.</span></p><p ><span >Doing a review of how you spend your days is very beneficial. You can use the information to plan your next one.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 88</span></h2><p ><span >Philosophy is above all liberal studies because she is the only one that makes a man free. The only value of liberal studies resides in how well they prepare the mind for the acquisition of moral values.</span></p><p ><span >Liberal studies don&rsquo;t teach a man how to deal with our own spiritual storms, driven by vice, or how to deal with misfortune and still keep course, or how to be pure and virtuous, or how to love your fellow men, or how to avoid being upset&hellip;</span></p><p ><span >Look for the best and be prepared for the opposite. How do you prepare? Rehearse every bad scenario and realize that you would not really lose anything necessary for your happiness.</span></p><p ><span >Bravery is the quality of character which despises, and defies, and demolishes all that usually terrify us.</span></p><p ><span >Learning also needs restraints. Avoid learning things that aren&rsquo;t necessary, that is intemperance. Life is too short for this.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 90</span></h2><p ><span >The natural and best way for men to organize is in a meritocracy, where merit is based on the quality of the character.</span></p><p ><span >Things that are essential are acquired with very little bother, it is only luxuries that required a lot of toil and effort.</span></p><p ><span >Luxury makes the mind a slave to the body, which brings in vices.</span></p><p ><span >Philosophy calls for peace and harmony in all mankind. She takes her aim at the state of happiness.</span></p><p ><span >The philosopher lives in accordance to nature. He teaches how to accept what has come to pass without complaints, but with equanimity. He teaches not to listen to false opinions. He teaches what are the standards that allow the true measurements of the value of everything. He condemns pleasures because he knows they always come in pair with subsequent regret. He commends the good things that always satisfy. He teaches that the luckiest man is the man that doesn&rsquo;t need luck. He teaches that the man who masters himself is a master of all.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 91</span></h2><p ><span >Things that are unexpected have a much bigger emotional impact. Prepare yourself ahead of time by rehearsing everything that can go wrong. This doesn&rsquo;t mean to</span><span>&nbsp;worry about it, but instead see how you will not lose anything that you requir</span><span >e in these scenarios. </span></p><p ><span >Time sweeps away everything. Everything around you, even the ruins, will be gone one day. Accept this reality, this is how life is.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 104</span></h2><p ><span >Take care of your health, not out of fear of death, but out of kindness for those who love you.</span></p><p ><span >Travel by itself will not make you a better man, and will not bring relaxation if your mind is troubled with unlimited cravings, worries and fears.</span></p><p ><span >If you do not want to worry and despair, stop hoping.</span></p><p ><span >The only way to have peace of mind in this world is to stop bothering with the future and to be confident that you can handle whatever Fortune throws at you.</span></p><p ><span >We don&rsquo;t lose confidence because things are hard. Instead, we think they are hard because we don&rsquo;t have confidence in our abilities.</span></p><p ><span >Wealth is the wage of slavery and you should look down on it. Don&rsquo;t fill your home with luxury.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 105</span></h2><p ><span >These are the things that will make another person want to destroy you: hope, fear, envy, hatred and contempt. If you want to stay safe, do not foster these in others.</span></p><p ><span >Contempt is not a big problem since it will not motivate a relentless attack on you.</span></p><p ><span >Avoid inspiring envy by keeping your satisfaction for yourself. Do not brag.</span></p><p ><span >An easy-going nature and limited power will protect you from hatred. Avoid being feared by limiting your power and keeping an easy-going character. People should not think that it is dangerous to offend you.</span></p><p ><span >Hatred can also be inspired by deliberately provoking someone, but that is easy to avoid.</span></p><p ><span >The best way to stay safe is to keep quiet: to speak with others as little as possible, and with yourself as much as possible.</span></p><p ><span >Never wrong others if you want peace of mind. To expect punishment is to suffer it, and to earn it is to expect it. You can never be free of the anxiety that your misdeed will be found out. [crime and punishment]</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 107</span></h2><p ><span >Life is rough for everyone, difficulties are part of it - accept it. Prepare yourself for rough times and you will face them more easily. [sweat in peace]</span></p><p ><span >The habit of continual reflection will protect you from being completely unprepared to misfortunes that strike you. It will be easier to face them with bravery instead of panic.</span></p><p ><span >Adopt a noble spirit that will let you face with bravery everything that Fortune throws at you.</span></p><p ><span >There is nothing better to do than to endure what cannot be cured (such as the fact that life will have ups and downs). You can either accept and endure this with honor, or complain about it (but still have to endure it) with dishonor.</span></p><p ><span >A noble spirit is the one that has put itself in the hands of Fate: its will is aligned with the will of God.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 108</span></h2><p ><span >Moderation also applies to the thirst for knowledge. Do not take in more than you can handle. It&rsquo;s a marathon, not a race.</span></p><p ><span >Everyone that comes in contact with a philosopher without hostility will get some benefit out of it.</span></p><p ><span >The crowd is the discourager of noble conduct. It can dispel your enthusiasm for personal growth.</span></p><p ><span >The seeds of virtue are present in every man. [mature King, Warrior, Magician, Lover]</span></p><p ><span >Writing in verse instead of prose is more efficient at reaching the reader because his attention is stronger. Beautiful verses have more impact than sterile intellectual cleverness.</span></p><p ><span >Everything that goes beyond your needs is unnecessary weight, a burden to the man that carries it.</span></p><p ><span >Ideas that were accepted by great men merit your consideration. Suspend your judgement.</span></p><p ><span >Never behave as if you had all the leisures in the world; every day could easily be your last, and time passes quickly. Welcome every day as if it was the finest day, seize it, study and learn while you still can.</span></p><p ><span >Search in philosophy for wisdom with immediate practical applications that help you in your pursuit of a happy life.</span></p><p ><span >People who don&rsquo;t practice what they preach are walking advertisements of the uselessness of their teachings. Words become your own when you put them in practice.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 114</span></h2><p ><span >People&rsquo;s speech matches their life (greek proverb). The accepted and popular forms of expressions are pulses on the state of society itself. An extravagant form in dress, writing, speech and entertainment is a sign of a diseased society.</span></p><p ><span >Writers must indulge into the popular expression of their times, which is tainted by society, in order to become popular and acclaimed.</span></p><p ><span >If you find yourself trying to buy furniture or clothes that are unusual or novelty, be careful that you are not driven by a habit of disdaining what is usual or customary. Don&rsquo;t seek praise from others.</span></p><p ><span >Everything such as gait, posture, speech, thoughts, style are directly affected by the quality of the spirit. A spirit that is in good condition will be observed by a firm, forceful and virile style and a brisk walking.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 122</span></h2><p ><span >Action is the theme and duty of life, and an active person rises with or even before the sunrise.</span></p><p ><span >People who don&rsquo;t get sunlight have a sickly complexion. This perverse aversion to sunlight is a sign of a diseased, inverted soul.</span></p><p ><span >An inverted soul will take pleasure in standing in total opposition to everything natural. If you let the disdain of the normal existence take hold, you will end up inverted, completely detached from nature.</span></p><p ><span >People who follow nature are straightforward and uncomplicated. It is simple to devote yourself to what is right.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 123</span></h2><p ><span >You will never have everything that you want, but it is in your power to cheerfully make the most of what comes your way.</span></p><p ><span >See difficult or irritating events that were not expected as a good test of character. Since you had not prepared your endurance for it, it is a very honest appraisal. The memory of how you behaved will be very good feedback for growth.</span></p><p ><span >When you feel like you are missing something, notice that it is rather a habit that is not being followed. Your own real self never misses anything.</span></p><p ><span >Until you live without something, it is hard to see how unnecessary they are.</span></p><p ><span >Guide your life by reason rather than by convention, by the example of the mass. Avoid associating with people who follow the conventional.</span></p><p ><span >Shut your ears against mischievous talk, for it plants a seed in your mind even if you rejected it in the moment. Steer clear of the voices that praise (and the people that exemplify) a life of indulging without moderation in every desire and that have an aversion to wisdom and moral.</span></p><p ><span >Strive to find pleasant the things that also are honorable. To do so you need to not crave what you are attracted to (wealth, pleasures, good looks, status) and not fear what you are repelled by (death, exertion, pain, disgrace, limited means). That is done by inverting the fight: retreat from what you are attracted to, and face what repels you [especially if you crave or fear it].</span></p>
