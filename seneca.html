    <h2  ><span >Letter 2</span></h2><p ><span >If you are able to stop and spend time alone, then it shows you have a well ordered mind.</span></p><p ><span >Better to read from a few authors you pick, and master them, than many.</span></p><p ><span >The poor man is the one who wants more, the cheerful and content man with low material wealth isn&rsquo;t poor.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 3</span></h2><p ><span >If you cannot trust a friend and tell him everything you think, then stop seeing him as a friend. Judge people before you give them your friendship, but trust them as if they were yourself after you grant it. When in a friend&rsquo;s company, it&rsquo;s as if you were with only yourself.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 5</span></h2><p ><span >Improve yourself for its own sake, not for appearances. Balance your behavior between the ideal and the popular morality; there is no charity in making your morality repulsive to others - keep it understandable. Simple living is better than penance.</span></p><p ><span >Cease to hope, and you will cease to fear. Hope, like fear, is set in the future. Limit your desires and you will cure fear.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 6</span></h2><p ><span >There is no enjoying the possession of wisdom (or anything of value) if you cannot share it.</span></p><p ><span >Surround yourself with people you want to be like; physically, so you can learn from their example. This is much more efficient than trying to learn from reading.</span></p><p ><span >Become your own friend, you will never be alone, and a friend to all.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 7</span></h2><p ><span >Avoid mass crowds, they will corrupt you no matter how good you are.</span></p><p ><span >Be very careful about entertainment, vices easily creep through it.</span></p><p ><span >Associate with people who can improve you, and welcome those you can improve. Men learn as they teach.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t desire the majority&rsquo;s approval, but instead see it as a red flag.</span></p><p ><span >A single friend is enough of an audience for anyone.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 8</span></h2><p ><span >Avoiding crowds and spending time in isolation doesn&rsquo;t mean you have shut off the world; you can in fact have a better impact in this way.</span></p><p ><span >Be very suspicious of the approval of the mob, or of the gifts of chance, they are bait - things that will own you instead of you owning them.</span></p><p ><span >The body needs to be treated somewhat strictly to prevent it from becoming disobedient to the spirit. Indulge it only in what it needs for good health (eg. just enough food for hunger, no luxury).</span></p><p ><span >It doesn&rsquo;t matter who speaks the truth, it belongs to everybody. Don&rsquo;t shut your ears to the truth because it is said by the enemy/rival.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 9</span></h2><p ><span >Be content with yourself. It is still normal to have needs, but they should never be a requirement for your happiness.</span></p><p ><span >Even if you are able to be happy without friends, you can still desire friendship. It is a natural impulse.</span></p><p ><span >If you make friends like business deals, only for their usefulness, they will leave you quickly when you are struggling and cannot fulfill your part. Instead, pursue friendship for its own sake.</span></p><p ><span >Leading a happy life is independent to any desire you manage to fulfill and to whatever is taken away from you. Indeed, the only true requirement is a rational and elevated spirit that treats fortune with disdain.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 11</span></h2><p ><span >Find a good man, somebody that is worth your reverence, to set your affection on, and do everything as if he saw what you are doing. See him as your guardian or your model. Use him as a standard to measure yourself against.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 12</span></h2><p ><span >Everyday should be lived as if it was the last, the one that completes your life. Death doesn&rsquo;t care about your age, it should always be right before your eyes. Everyday, say &ldquo;I have lived.&rdquo;</span></p><p ><span >If God adds the morrow, accept it joyfully. Don&rsquo;t worry over it.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 15</span></h2><p ><span >Being in good health is being in the pursuit of wisdom; without wisdom the mind is sick.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t waste too much time training the body when you could be training the mind instead.</span></p><p ><span >Give time time off, but in a way that refreshes it, not excessively relaxed.</span></p><p ><span >Instead of asking fortune for this and that, demand yourself to stop asking. You may be dead tomorrow, how will the thing you are asking for help you?</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 16</span></h2><p ><span >No one can lead a bearable life without the pursuit of wisdom, and the perfection of wisdom makes it happy.</span></p><p ><span >Making noble resolutions is less important than keeping those you have already made.</span></p><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t let your spiritual enthusiasm cool off or fall away. Keep hold of it until it becomes a spiritual disposition.</span></p><p ><span >Nature&rsquo;s wants are small, all of the natural desires are limited. If you are after something that cannot ever be satisfied, be sure that it isn&rsquo;t natural.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 18</span></h2><p ><span >Live in poverty for a few days: eat nothing but cheap bread, sleep on a cheap bed and dress with ugly clothes. This will help build your confidence that you are sated without all the riches in your life, and that you would still be happy if you lost them. This will allow you to own riches without fearing to lose them.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 26</span></h2><p ><span >Imagine today is the last day of your life. All that you&rsquo;ve done in the past isn&rsquo;t a good measure of how good your spirit is; how you act today is a better measure. Without anxiety about the past then, act today as if it was the single day you are judged for.</span></p><p ><span >The only chain holding you is your love of life. Don&rsquo;t throw this love away, but weaken it. Being prepared to die is the ultimate freedom.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 27</span></h2><p ><span >Look for enduring good instead of fleeting pleasures; look for what the spirit discovers for itself within itself.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 28</span></h2><p ><span >Travelling will not heal you when the reason for your anxiety and depression is in your spirit. Cure your affliction before travelling, and everywhere you arrive will feel like a hospitable home.</span></p><p ><span >It&rsquo;s better to live away from the city and its turmoil when building up the strength of the mind.</span></p><p ><span >Observe your behavior and notice your wrongdoings. Until you are aware that something is wrong, how can you desire fixing it?</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 33</span></h2><p ><span >Don&rsquo;t attempt to fill your mind with quotes and short excerpts, this is &nbsp;a strategy for novices and children. Give up the hope of grasping the genius of a person without examining and consuming it as a whole.</span></p><p ><span >Grown men shouldn&rsquo;t memorize sayings, but create their own. To remember something is to safeguard it in your memory. To know something is to make it your own, free from the original.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 40</span></h2><p ><span >Speak slowly, you cannot preserve your modesty if you are speaking too quickly</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 41</span></h2><p ><span >No man is good without God, we need his help to rise above fortune.</span></p><p ><span >Living in accordance with his own nature is the purpose of man. His ideal state is when he fulfills that purpose. Doing so should be easy, but is made complicated by the madness of the crowd.</span></p><h2  ><span >Letter 47</span></h2><p ><span >You can find men of good character everywhere. Never value a man by his social status, wealth, job or clothes; that is not what matters.</span></p><p ><span >Some men are slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition, but all men are slaves to hope and fear.</span></p><p ><span >No state of slavery is more disgraceful than the one that is self-imposed.</span></p><p ><span >Respect is love, and love cannot mix with fear.</span></p><p ><span >&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
